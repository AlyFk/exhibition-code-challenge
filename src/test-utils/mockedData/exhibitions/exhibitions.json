      "description": "The Art Institute of Chicago proudly presents Iterations, a series of new performance commissions that underline the wide range of artistic practices and attitudes in performance today. New works by Alexandra Bachzetsis, Math Bass, Cevdet Erek, Ralph Lemon, Paulina Olowska, Cally Spooner and Evelyn T. Wang\u2014anchored in choreography, sound art, spoken word performance, installation, music, gesture and movement research\u2014explore how performance practice is situated in the context of the Art Institute of Chicago, in our distinct spaces and amid our wide-ranging collection. Unfolding as an iterative exhibition over the course of three years, Iterations takes place in different durations and in various spaces across the museum, including exhibition and collection galleries, interstitial spaces and theaters.  \n\nWhile performance has often been understood as a singular event in time, dependent on the physical presence of an artist, contemporary approaches have produced a shift in this thinking. Moving between genres, spaces and durations, the artists in Iterations propose performance as a set of artistic strategies that encompass various media as well as multiple and shifting temporalities.  The series as a whole follows this iterative rhythm and exists as a hybrid between exhibition and event, suggesting how the museum can be a host to art works that emerge and disappear, re-emerge and are sustained in time. As the artists move through and produce new works in a variety of spaces across the Art Institute, each iteration in the series proposes different spatial conditions as well. The museum\u2019s theater (arguably, one of the more traditional spaces for performance) provides a radically different meaning and context than the exhibition and collection galleries or one the many interstitial and transitional spaces in the Art Institute\u2019s building. As such, iterations does not only pose the question of when and how, but also where performance can take place. \n\nFurthermore, iterations states questions that have to do with a politics of care. The Art Institute of Chicago is a caretaker of art through presentation and conservation. Increasingly, as performance has become a widespread phenomenon in museum programming and exhibitions\u2014and moving image works and sound installations similarly challenge prevalent definitions of objects and object production\u2014museums are shifting their understanding of what caretaking means in a collection context. How can museums take care of moving bodies or ephemeral gestures, of words being uttered and installations that change over time? What does the museum have to do, what does it need, in order to take care of performance\u2014both in terms of presentation and embedding it in the collection? Building on histories of instruction-based art in Conceptual Art and performance in the visual arts, iterations seeks to explore these questions through the practice of commissioning; engaging in a long-term dialogue with artists about the conception and production of, and care for a new performance work at the Art Institute of Chicago. \n\nThe following commissions will be presented in 2019:\n\nCevdet Erek (b. 1974, Istanbul, Turkey)\nchi\u00e7i\u00e7i\u00e7ichi\nFebruary 28 \u2013 April 28, 2019\nOpening performance on February 28, 2019, 6:00 pm\nKenneth and Anne Griffin Court\n\nCally Spooner (b. 1983, Ascot, United Kingdom)\nDEAD TIME (a crime novel)\nApril 22-28, 2019 \nInstallation with continuous live performance during museum opening hours\nBucksbaum Gallery 188\n\nAlexandra Bachzetsis (b. 1974, Zurich, Switzerland)\nChasing a Ghost\nOctober 31, November 1, November 2, 2019\nDaily performances, times to be announced\nChicago Stock Exchange Trading Room\n\nThe exhibition will continue in 2020 and 2021 with new works by Math Bass (b. 1981, New York, USA), Ralph Lemon (b. 1952, Cincinnati, USA), Paulina Olowska (b. 1976, Gda\u0144sk, Poland) and Evelyn T. Wang (b. 1982, Chengdu, China).\n\n\niterations is curated by Hendrik Folkerts (Dittmer Curator of Contemporary Art, Art Institute of Chicago).\n\niterations is made possible through the foundational support of the Society of Contemporary Art at the Art Institute of Chicago.",

      "is_featured": true,
      "description": "For Paulina Olowska (born 1976), painting and performance are closely entwined. Her performances function as subtext for her paintings, drawing out reciprocal relationships between scenography and movement, the still image and the moving body. With her newly commissioned work Naughty Nymphs in the Courtyard of the Favorites, the artist finds inspiration in the Art Institute\u2019s galleries of American art, where Ellsworth Kelly\u2019s The Chicago Panels (1989\u201399) surround an atrium housing Neoclassical sculptures\u2014mythological and idealized manifestations of the nude female body. Investigating the sexual politics of space and building upon her long-term interest in images from fashion and advertising, Olowska critically engages with representations of the female body in this three-day performance event. \n\nNaughty Nymphs in the Courtyard of the Favorites centers on the particular aesthetic of the soft-core magazine Viva. Specifically developed for female readers, Viva emerged in the 1970s era of \u201cporno chic,\u201d when pornography entered the mainstream consciousness of America. The magazine\u2019s hazy and seductive eroticism\u2014reminiscent of the era\u2019s French Emmanuelle films\u2014 combined provocative writing on male and female sexuality with fashion editorials and full-frontal male nudity. Olowska presents this performance in collaboration with four muses adopting the role of nymphs, whose whispers resonate among the marble surfaces of the courtyard turned harem; three transparent paintings by Olowska inspired by Viva; Kelly\u2019s enormous, opaque panels; and the bodies moving between them.",

      "is_featured": false,
      "description": "At the center of Cally Spooner\u2019s DEAD TIME is a 63-page score of the same title, which consists of drawings, photos, captions of her recent work, and fan mail, both borrowed and self-authored. The score is hosted on the front of a 49-foot-long wall, whose smooth surface is typical of a contemporary art gallery. Yet the rear of the wall is raw and unfinished, like a vacant backstage.\n \nEach day this wall becomes the scenography for a live performance of the score, enacted by living, prerecorded, and inanimate elements. These include a dancer who attempts to repair her body and prolong time; an actor who strives for anatomical perfection only to stagnate; and a narrator who ruminates on failing nervous systems, financial centers, and a celebrity under attack because of #MeToo shame. Disembodied voices call out \u201cMother\u201d repeatedly, while Ivanka Trump narrates her capacity to \u201carchitect\u201d her life, work, and children. Alongside, there is the sound of the dancer, sniffling and gasping, as she\u2019s suffering from a head cold. A cellist plays to the tune of shame, repeating a Netflix theme song, and a stainless-steel drinking fountain runs perpetually. Disconnected from a public water line and recirculating its own supply of overly chlorinated, poisonous water, the fountain is cleaning itself to death. Each of these elements, drawn out from the score, occurs in the gallery according to its own duration, repertoire, and speed. Once a day, for an hour, all the elements collide.\n \nAt once an installation, an instruction, and a live performance, DEAD TIME takes its name from the cinematic technique temps morts (lit. \u201cdead time\u201d), in which the camera is left running to film unplanned and unscripted occurrences. These seemingly \u201cdead\u201d moments may, in fact, be brimming with life. Living and nonliving elements overlap, dancers collapse into inertia, repetitive and monotonous sounds penetrate the space, overlooked details become legible, scenes are inactive and empty, yet captivating. Here, hidden and disavowed temporalities arrive, providing an alternative to how neoliberalism and corporate capitalism aim to manage, monetize, and control all life, which DEAD TIME as a whole reflects on, stages, and resists.",

      "description": "Cevdet Erek (born 1974, Istanbul) is an artist, musician, and architect whose work revolves around sound as a measure for space, time, and the world around us. His newly commissioned project, chi\u00e7i\u00e7i\u00e7ichici\u00e7i, consists of a 16-channel sound installation, graphic notations, and modified metal fencing. It is installed in Griffin Court, a space that connects and unites multiple functions, positions, and perspectives in the museum. \nchi\u00e7i\u00e7i\u00e7ichici\u00e7i stages an interaction between visual, written, sonic, and architectural elements to investigate our motion and position in space. The letters on the wall, all varied arrangements of the work\u2019s onomatopoeic title, anticipate the prerecorded sounds that permeate Griffin Court through each of the 16 speakers in the installation. Some speakers are directed toward specific locations, while others accompany our passage through the space. The subtle percussive proposals of the title and their accompanying soundtrack resonate with the chime of the fences when touched in passing or played with intent, the sound affected by our pace and movement.\nThe wall is simultaneously a soundtrack and an instrument that uses both visual and per-cussive elements of language. Through the experience of seeing and hearing chi\u00e7i\u00e7i\u00e7ichici\u00e7i, Erek suggests sound as the connective tissue linking our position in space to the objects and architectures around us in an ever-shifting proximity.\nchi\u00e7i\u00e7i\u00e7ichici\u00e7i is the first installment of Iterations, a series of new performance commissions occurring in 2019\u201321. Iterations is made possible through the generous support of the Society of Contemporary Art.",

      "description": "When Vincent van Gogh decided to become an artist at the age of 27, he had already lived in 16 cities and had failed at five different professions. Though finally settled in his career, his home life was anything but\u2014Van Gogh remained a wanderer until his death 10 years later, despite his dream of a permanent home. With each move, the change in environment took his artistic aesthetic in a new direction. \n\nTo complement the exhibition Van Gogh\u2019s Bedrooms, which explores the theme of home in the artist\u2019s oeuvre, the Ryerson and Burnham Libraries present Van Gogh: In Search Of, a focused exhibition featuring photographs of the many residences and locales Van Gogh frequented over the course of his artistic career. \n\nThe selection of images, drawn largely from the libraries\u2019 own archives, were made possible by a friendship established between the Art Institute and the Van Gogh family in the 1940s. While preparing for a Van Gogh exhibition at the museum in 1949, Art Institute Director Daniel Catton Rich and Public Relations Counsel Peter Pollack visited the artist\u2019s nephew, Vincent Willem van Gogh, to ask for a loan of many of his uncle's paintings for the show. A close friendship among the men developed, and the three of them set out to visit most of the sites captured by the famous artist in his fabulous paintings. These site visits were documented by Pollack, a trained photographer. This remarkable assemblage of images offers a unique glimpse into the artist's life seen through the lens of the photographer.",

      "description": "Trade literature - also known as trade, manufacturers\u2019 or commercial catalogs - has been an indispensable tool of the architecture and design profession ever since its popularization in the late 19th century. The earliest precursors to modern trade literature emerged from European publishers and merchants in the 15th and 17th centuries though, given the degree to which the United States would come to dominate this field, it may arguably be Benjamin Franklin\u2019s book, fireplace and stove catalogs of 1744 to which the legacy is rightfully owed.\nCreated by merchants and manufacturers to promote their products and services, these publications were among the most widespread forms of early American advertising. Technological advances of the Industrial Revolution combined with modernization following the Civil War brought advances in printing technology that both reduced production costs and improved the quality of printed materials, the latter of which made the publication of primarily visual materials more viable.\nAmerica\u2019s westward expansion, fueled by the Homestead Act of 1862 and the growth of railroads, set the stage for the introduction of what was to be become the first mass-distributed trade literature: the mail order catalog. By appealing to rural consumers who wanted the selection and pricing of the big city while offering \u201csatisfaction guaranteed or your money back,\u201d Montgomery Ward tapped into a growing market that by 1897 was already generating nearly $7 million in annual sales.\nArchitectural building materials were commonly marketed in trade catalogs as early as the 1850s in such publications as \u201cPorter\u2019s Stone Dressing Machine\u201d (New York, 1855) and the Buffalo Iron Eagle Works catalog of 1854. Beginning around the turn of the century, companies such as Sears Roebuck, Aladdin, Hodgson and many others started selling \u201ckit houses\u201d: inexpensive, customizable mail order houses shipped straight from the factory for assembly either by the new homeowner or a local contractor. Over 200,000 were sold before falling out of favor in the early 1940s. Similarly, businesses such as the William A. Radford Company (see item #1) sold catalogs of well-crafted building plans at various levels of affordability for families and entrepreneurs wishing to build an attractive structure without having to pay an architect's commission.\nDespite their ephemeral nature, trade catalogs remain an important primary resource for the study of historical design and construction practices, and trends in both industry and culture.",

      "description": "One of Chicago\u2019s great design stories emerged from the Container Corporation of America (CCA) in the middle of the 20th century. The CCA\u2019s founder, Walter Paepcke, was an influential patron of the arts and was integral in bringing the New Bauhaus, later folded into the Illinois Institute of Technology, to the city. At CCA he enlisted exceptionally talented graphic designers such as the Austrian Herbert Bayer and the Chicagoan John Massey, whose work for CCA is featured in this exhibition. \n\nMassey began working at CCA in 1957, and upon his appointment as head of design in 1964 he formed a research arm, the Center for Advanced Research in Design (CARD). The work of CARD extended beyond the traditional work of CCA to projects such as the Chicago Civic Poster campaign. Supported fully by Paepcke, this unusual arrangement enabled great creativity and innovation within a corporate structure. The portfolio of Massey\u2019s work recently acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago demonstrates the designer\u2019s ingenuity across a range of projects. \n\nThis exhibition features a set of posters for the CCA\u2019s subsidiary Cart\u00f3n de Venezuela. Intended as a calendar for clients, each poster represents a different month of the year. The strong, clean lines and bold colors reflect one of Massey\u2019s primary influences, the Swiss school of design. These posters represent an overall approach to design by Massey and illustrate the important body of work he developed while the director of CARD.",

      "description": "Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio earned great notoriety for his revolutionary style and for his unconventional process of painting directly from live models. The special loan of Orazio Gentileschi's The Lute Player from the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC enables us to show how four other painters in early 17th-century Rome assimilated his style in their own distinct ways. The Lute Player joins three other Caravaggesque paintings from the Art Institute's collection by Giovanni Baglione, Bartolomeo Manfredi, and Cecco del Caravaggio.\n\nGentileschi was not only a close associate of Caravaggio's, he was also one of the leading Caravaggisti in the second decade of the 17th century. In fact, due to the overt stylistic similarities between Gentileschi's The Lute Player and Caravaggio's own interpretation of the scene, many critics in the 18th and 19th centuries mistakenly attributed this work to Caravaggio. However, more recent scholarship secures the painting within the corpus of Gentileschi's work and underlines how he mixed key aspects of Caravaggio's style with his own signature elements.",

      "description": "After a historic meeting in Florence last fall with His Holiness Pope Francis at the iconic Baptistery of Saint John, Marc Chagall\u2019s White Crucifixion returns home to the Art Institute galleries this spring. One of the museum\u2019s most significant works of modern art\u2014and the Pope\u2019s favorite painting\u2014White Crucifixion has become a universally potent symbol of sacrifice and persecution with its blending of Christian and Jewish themes. We welcome the masterpiece back to the galleries with a special presentation celebrating its art historical significance and its continued ability to inspire Chicagoans and people around the world.\n\nWhite Crucifixion marked a critical turning point for Chagall: it was the first and largest in an important series of his compositions to feature an image of the Crucifixion. While Chagall included many recognizable elements of the traditional Christian iconography on the canvas, he combined them with markers of Jesus\u2019s Jewish identity. His loincloth is made from a ritual Jewish prayer shawl, or tallit. The mourning angels that are typically seen in Crucifixion images here become three biblical patriarchs and a matriarch, all dressed in traditional Jewish garments. Christ\u2019s dual identity is further extended by the inscription above his head\u2014\u201cINRI\u201d (Jesus of Nazareth, King of Jews), paired with the Aramaic translation written in Hebrew characters. At his feet stands a lit menorah.\n\nChagall placed the crucified Jesus amid scenes of contemporary persecution in Nazi Germany. From the pillaged village and fleeing villagers on the left side of the canvas to the synagogue and its Torah ark going up in flames on the right, the violent images Chagall depicted came from actual events in the years leading up to the painting, events that culminated in Kristallnacht (\u201cThe Night of Broken Glass\u201d), a systematic attack by the Nazis on Jews within the German Reich in 1937. After the first exhibition of the painting, however, Chagall painted over specific Nazi symbols in the work, making a more universal image of persecution and suffering.\n\nThe broad message of White Crucifixion has found meaning to many people over the years, including Pope Francis, who has often mentioned the importance of the painting in interviews. On November 10, 2015, he was able to see this special painting in person. The work, which had been on loan to the Palazzo Strozzi in Florence for their exhibition Divine Beauty from Van Gogh to Chagall and Fontana, was moved to the Baptistery of Saint John across from the Duomo for His Holiness\u2019s inaugural visit to Florence. Douglas Druick, President and Eloise W. Martin Director, joined by Arturo Galansino, director general of the Palazzo Strozzi Foundation, greeted the pope as he arrived at the baptistery and took in Chagall\u2019s masterpiece for several minutes, while 50,000 cheering people lined the streets outside.\n\nIn 2006, Pope Francis said, \u201cGreat artists know how to present the tragic and painful realities of life with beauty.\u201d By that standard alone, White Crucifixion is a masterwork. As it returns from its remarkable visit and takes its place in the Modern Wing, its divine beauty and emotional power resonate more clearly than ever.",

      "is_featured": false,
      "description": "The three slide projections in this presentation, shown together in 1975 but rarely seen since, mark a point of intersection between land art and body art\u2014two areas pioneered by sculptor and media artist Dennis Oppenheim (American, 1938\u20132011). In these intimate and personal works, the artist used performances for the camera to explore the theme of mourning and to model an intergenerational transfer of psychic or creative energies. Shot from a helicopter, 2000' Shadow Projection (1972), shows the artist alone in a field, standing in the stark beam of a far-reaching searchlight; he repeatedly plays a one-note dirge on a trumpet, an act of memorial to his father, who had died the same year. In Ground Gel #2 (1972), also photographed from above, he whirls his young daughter, Chandra, round and round, their figures appearing to merge with each other as well as with the ground as the slides progress. Whispering, \u201cI want to go there...\u201d as he whirls his daughter around, Oppenheim propels an exchange of action and energy that seems to exceed the material boundaries of his own bodily form. Grandfather and granddaughter meet symbolically in the third work, Polarities (1972). Using red magnesium flares, Oppenheim created two \u201clandscape drawings,\u201d together stretching more than 1,000 feet, by plotting enlarged versions of a doodle drawn by his father the night before he died and one of Chandra\u2019s first artworks.\n\nSlides give a perfect metaphor for themes of separation and interdependence, causing images to shift and dissolve like the bodies they symbolize or depict. \u201cMy work,\u201d Oppenheim described in 1973, \u201clies on the attempt to remove the frontier between an action directed from within the bounds of my life and the one I try to direct, at the same time, beyond those bounds.\u201d\n\nThe exhibition is presented jointly by the Department of Photography and the Department of Modern and Contemporary Art. A selection of related lithographs by Dennis Oppenheim, recent gifts of Irving Stenn, Jr., is on view nearby in Gallery 189.",

      "title": "Martin Puryear: Multiple Dimensions",
      "is_featured": false,
      "description": "One of the most renowned artists working today, Martin Puryear is celebrated for his elegant but playful sculpture and his devotion to craft. Lesser known is the extensive iterative process of drawing and printmaking that is essential to the artist\u2019s studio practice. This exhibition is the first to draw back the curtain on that practice. Featuring over 100 drawings and prints as well as 12 sculptures\u2014many borrowed directly from the artist and never displayed before\u2014the presentation offers an unprecedented look into Puryear\u2019s inspirations, methods, and transformative process.\n\nMartin Puryear has had a long relationship with Chicago and the Art Institute. He lived in the city for 12 years, \u2028and the museum has long been supportive of his work\u2014acquiring key pieces in the 1980s, organizing an extensive survey in 1991, and conserving many of his fire-damaged early prints and drawings after that show. Puryear has responded in kind, giving the museum a double-sided drawing for his sculpture Sanctuary and participating \u2028generously and closely in the development of this exhibition, including loaning many works that he has never shared publicly before.\n\nUniting these rarely seen drawings, several sculptures, and selections from his sketchbooks, Martin Puryear: Multiple Dimensions traces the artist\u2019s career from his student days at Catholic University in the early 1960s through the present, with works created as recently as 2014. Critical to Puryear\u2019s development were his formative years spent with the Peace Corps in Sierra Leone (1964\u20131966), a period in which he was inspired by and gave expression to buildings, flora, insects, animals, and children\u2014the entirety of his environment. Since then, Puryear has returned to many of these themes, experimenting with scale, materials, and varying levels of abstraction. In the exhibition, visitors can witness \u2028this evolution of thought\u2014how a sketch of a house in Sierra Leone is transformed 10 years later into an abstracted proto-sculptural form, or how a head-like shape is reworked in bronze, wood, black Cont\u00e9 crayon, and graphite.\n\nBy bringing to life the artist\u2019s uncanny ability to make forms that are suggestive, playful, and transformative, all while remaining anchored in the world, this display of Puryear\u2019s explorations across visual ideas and media offers a 360-degree view of the creative process of a contemporary master.\n\nSponsors\n\nMartin Puryear: Multiple Dimensions is organized by the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSupport for the exhibition is provided by the Morton International Exhibition Fund and the Kemper Educational and Charitable Fund.\n\nAnnual support for Art Institute exhibitions is provided by the Exhibitions Trust: Kenneth Griffin, Robert M. and Diane v.S. Levy, Thomas and Margot Pritzker, Betsy Bergman Rosenfield and Andrew M. Rosenfield, the Earl and Brenda Shapiro Foundation, and the Woman\u2019s Board.",

      "is_featured": false,
      "description": "Immerse yourself in the rich cultures of some of Asia\u2019s most remote regions with this summer\u2019s exhibition Vanishing Beauty. Drawn from Art Institute Trustee and accomplished photographer Barbara Levy Kipper\u2019s sweeping collection of Asian jewelry and ritual objects promised to the museum in 2014, the exhibition presents more than 300 exquisitely crafted works\u2014highlights from this expansive, diverse, and thoughtfully assembled collection\u2014that offer a panoramic view of the fast-disappearing nomadic and tribal cultures of Asia.\n\nAmong the pieces on view are a vast collection of Tibetan and greater Himalayan Buddhist ritual objects and adornments, Islamic silver jewelry from the nomadic tribes of Turkmenistan and the city-states of Uzbekistan, tribal and folk jewelry from across South Asia, personal ornaments from the Indonesian archipelago, and the monumental jewelry of southwestern China\u2019s ethnic minorities. Tying all these disparate objects together is the fact that the peoples who produced them have largely been pushed into the margins, surviving today only in the remotest of areas. In these cultures, jewelry is auspicious and holds great meaning; it is rarely mere adornment. Necklaces, pendants, earrings, and headdresses all serve social, ritual, or talismanic purposes.\n\nA highlight of this manifold use of jewelry is a cobra-like headdress (perak) from Tibet composed of long rows of turquoise stones that, when worn, cascade from a woman\u2019s forehead down the length of her back. A stone synonymous with Tibetan jewelry, turquoise is believed to hold mystical healing properties, and its quantity and quality act as status symbols for the wealth of a woman and her family. With more than 100 large turquoise stones as well as small amulet cases (gaus), this stunning perak signifies great spiritual and earthly fortune for its wearer and joins hundreds of similarly meaning-filled objects in this vibrant display of craftsmanship and culture.\n\nThe exhibition flows through five geographical areas\u2014from mountaintop monasteries in the Himalayas to oasis settlements of the Central Asian steppes marked by grand blue-tiled mosques, madrasahs, and mausolea; on to the pastoral regions and deserts of South Asia and the most secluded islands of Indonesia; and finally to the river valleys in China\u2019s mountainous Guizhou province. Providing an immersive experience with music and video installations throughout the galleries, Vanishing Beauty brings these dispersed cultures to life through a dazzling array of extraordinary objects, each rich with stories from some of the most inaccessible regions of the world.\n\nPurchase Vanishing Beauty Asian Jewelry and Ritual Objects from the Barbara and David Kipper Collection and experience the exhibition through its accompanying catalogue.  All purchases support the many fine programs of the museum.\nSponsors\nVanishing Beauty: Asian Jewelry and Ritual Objects from the Barbara and David Kipper Collection is generously sponsored by Barbara Levy Kipper and the Kipper Family Foundation.\n\nAnnual support for Art Institute exhibitions is provided by the Exhibitions Trust: Neil Bluhm and the Bluhm Family Charitable Foundation, Kenneth Griffin, Robert M. and Diane v.S. Levy, Thomas and Margot Pritzker, Anne and Chris Reyes, Betsy Bergman Rosenfield and Andrew M. Rosenfield, the Earl and Brenda Shapiro Foundation, and the Woman\u2019s Board.",

Since the last such presentation in 2012, the department has acquired 105 objects, some by purchase, others by gift.\n\nThis display features 39 of those works\u2014showcasing a remarkable variety of cultures, periods, and textile types that mirror the encyclopedic scope of the museum as a whole. The objects are divided into three sections: contemporary weavings, American and European textiles, and Middle Eastern and Asian works. There are masterpieces in each section.\n\nThe installation also continues the celebration of the museum\u2019s long and symbiotic relationship with the School of the Art Institute, as several of the contemporary works are by three artists with connections to the school.\n\nAs this presentation attests\u2014in its breadth and its quality\u2014the last few years have indeed been fortuitous for the Department of Textiles, and our gratitude is extended to all whose generosity helped strengthen this collection, either through the direct gift of objects or through the contribution of funds that made acquisitions possible",

      "description": "Japan has a long history of recognizing the talents of great female poets. During the Heian period (794\u20131185), the golden age of the Japanese imperial court, women stood out as practitioners of a specific type of poetry called waka and the novel. This exhibition focuses on two most of the country\u2019s most renowned female poets, Murasaki Shikibu (about 973\u20131016) and Ono no Komachi (active about 833\u201357). Although little is known about them, these women inspired numerous legends, some of which became the subjects of N\u014d and Kabuki plays, as well as woodblock prints. The images in this exhibition, made during the Edo (1615\u20131868) and Meiji (1868\u20131912) periods, show the various ways in which artists have interpreted these stories.",

      "title": "Invisible Man: Gordon Parks and Ralph Ellison in Harlem",
      "is_featured": false,
      "description": "Gordon Parks and Ralph Ellison are both recognized as major figures in American art and literature: Parks, a renowned photographer and filmmaker, was best known for his poignant and humanizing photo-essays for Life magazine. Ellison authored one of the most acclaimed\u2014and debated\u2014novels of the 20th century, Invisible Man (1952). What is less known about these two esteemed artists is that their friendship, coupled with a shared vision of racial injustices and a belief in the communicative power of photography, inspired collaboration on two projects, one in 1948 and another in 1952.\n\nCapitalizing on the growing popularity of the picture press, Parks and Ellison first joined forces in 1948, on an essay titled \u201cHarlem Is Nowhere,\u201d for \u201948: The Magazine of the Year, which focused on Harlem\u2019s Lafargue Mental Hygiene Clinic as a means of highlighting the social and economic effects of racism and segregation. In 1952 they again worked together, producing \u201cA Man Becomes Invisible\u201d for Life magazine, which illustrated scenes from Ellison\u2019s Invisible Man. Both projects aimed to make the black experience visible in postwar America, with Harlem as its nerve center. However, neither essay was published as originally conceived\u2014the first was lost, while only a fragment of the second appeared in print.\n\nThis exhibition reunites for the first time the surviving photographs and texts intended for the two projects, including never-before-seen photographs by Parks from the collections of the Art Institute and the Gordon Parks Foundation and unpublished manuscripts by Ellison. Revealed in these frank depictions of Harlem is Ellison and Parks\u2019s symbiotic insistence on making race a larger, universal issue, finding an alternative, productive means of representing African American life, and importantly, staking a claim for the black individual within\u2014rather than separate from\u2014the breadth of American culture.",

      "title": "America after the Fall: Painting in the 1930s",
      "is_featured": false,
      "description": "What is American art? That is a question the country\u2019s artists asked and answered in myriad ways during the decade spanning the economic crash of 1929 through America\u2019s entry into World War II. With economic downturn at home and the rising threat of fascism abroad, artists of the time applied their individualized visions of the nation to rethinking modernism. This exhibition brings together 50 works by some of the foremost artists of the era\u2014including Edward Hopper, Georgia O\u2019Keeffe, and Grant Wood\u2014to examine the landscape of the United States during the Great Depression and the many avenues artists explored as they sought to forge a new national art and identity.\n\nCollectively, the aesthetically and politically varied works produced in the 1930s paint a revealing portrait of the nation\u2019s evolving psyche. Edward Hopper\u2019s reflective, melancholy approach to homegrown subjects is quite different from the bold romanticism of Thomas Hart Benton and his fellow Regionalists, who sought to create a national art that glorified America. Painters such as Philip Evergood and Ben Shahn used social realism to protest political attitudes of the time, highlighting the plights of migrant sharecroppers, Jewish immigrants, and other marginalized members of society. Racial issues also came to the fore: Joe Jones chillingly depicted a lynching in American Justice, while Aaron Douglas inserted a more inclusive vision of black culture into the heroic histories of the United States. History, in fact, was frequently used to speak to present times; realist Charles Sheeler linked the earlier, spare American aesthetic of Shaker objects to his exploration of the contemporary, while Grant Wood took on the country\u2019s founding myths in works such as Parson Weems\u2019 Fable.\n\nAt the same time, other artists reinvigorated the revolt against representational style, championing nonobjective art as a form that spoke deeply to modern concerns. The Park Avenue Cubists continued to evolve a European-based abstraction, and modernists such as Stuart Davis and Charles Demuth applied a precise, geometric vocabulary to American architecture and advertising.\n\nBringing these diverse works of art together, America after the Fall tells the story of a nation\u2019s fall from grace and irrevocable changes to the American dream. Following its installation at the Art Institute, the exhibition travels to the Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Orangerie in Paris and London\u2019s Royal Academy, marking the first time many of these iconic American works\u2014including Grant Wood\u2019s American Gothic\u2014have journeyed beyond North America. For French and British audiences, this traveling exhibition offers an unprecedented opportunity to experience these masterpieces firsthand. For all the show\u2019s visitors, the presentation affords a trailblazing look at the turbulent economic, political, and aesthetic world of the 1930s and the critical and dynamic process of rethinking modernism that it fostered.",
